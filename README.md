*Abstract:*

Efficient product packing is critical in the logistics and shipping industry, where improper space utilization can lead to significant financial and environmental costs. Inefficient packing results in wasted space, increased shipping expenses, excess packaging material usage, and higher fuel consumption, ultimately contributing to carbon emissions due to greater shipment volumes.

This project addresses these issues by developing an advanced algorithm-based solution that optimizes the packing of products of varying shapes and sizes into predefined cartons, minimizing the number of cartons used. The system takes input on product dimensions, shape, and quantity, then calculates the optimal carton size and orientation, mapping them to available carton options. It evaluates multiple orientations and stacking possibilities to determine the most efficient packing arrangement, with buffer space for packaging materials, and provides alerts for custom cartons when necessary.

In addition to core packing optimization, the system offers a Buffer Suggestion feature, which calculates the ideal buffer space based on product type, fragility, and size, ensuring proper protection for perishable and delicate items. The system also includes an Orientation and Stacking recommendation, suggesting the best way to pack each item, including whether stacking is possible based on weight and shape constraints.

Another feature is Pick a Box feature enables users to select carton sizes according to their specific vehicle requirements, making it easy to match packed cartons to available transport options. This helps businesses further streamline their logistics, reducing the need for additional repacking and ensuring efficient use of vehicle space.

By automating the packing process, this solution eliminates the manual trial-and-error method, saving time and labor. The system also converts measurements into standard units for consistency and provides a final packing strategy that minimizes the total shipping volume, helping businesses save on costs and reduce their environmental footprint. This comprehensive solution empowers businesses to optimize their packing and shipping processes, making them more cost-effective, eco-friendly, and adaptable to specific transportation needs.
